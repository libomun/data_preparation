# data_preparation

Data preparation, also known as data preprocessing, is a crucial step in the data analysis and machine learning pipeline. It involves transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis or training machine learning models. Data preparation typically includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning: This step involves handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and removing or correcting any inconsistencies or errors in the data. Missing values can be imputed or removed based on the nature of the data and the analysis objectives. Outliers, which are extreme values that deviate significantly from the majority of the data, can be handled by either removing them or applying appropriate statistical techniques.

Data Integration: In some cases, data may be scattered across multiple sources or in different formats. Data integration involves combining data from various sources and resolving any discrepancies or inconsistencies in variable names, formats, or values.

Data Transformation: Data transformation aims to improve the quality and usefulness of the data. It may involve converting variables into different formats (e.g., scaling numerical variables, encoding categorical variables), creating new derived variables, or applying mathematical or statistical operations to the data.

Feature Selection/Extraction: Feature selection involves identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features (variables) from the dataset that are most informative for the analysis or model training. Feature extraction, on the other hand, involves creating new features by combining or transforming the existing features to capture essential information.

Data Splitting: This step involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to build the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters or perform model selection, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model on unseen data.

Data Encoding: Categorical variables are often encoded into numerical values before feeding them into machine learning algorithms. Common encoding techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding.

Data Scaling/Normalization: It is often necessary to scale or normalize the numerical features to ensure that they are on a similar scale. This helps prevent certain features from dominating the model training process due to their larger magnitude.

Handling Imbalanced Data: If the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that the classes or categories are not represented equally, additional techniques such as oversampling or undersampling can be applied to address the imbalance and improve model performance.

# Introduction
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.
This project explore water quality data systematically using data preparation techniques, such as Data Cleaning, Data Integration, Data Transformation, Feature Selection/Extraction, Data Splitting, Data Encoding, Data Scaling/Normalization, Handling Imbalanced Data
